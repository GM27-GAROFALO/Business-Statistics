🔍  Insights from Applied Statistical Methods to develop a financial analysis of 14 companies within the same sector, focusing on liquidity, profitability, and debt management. Here are some key findings and insights from my report, “Statistica per analisi economiche e aziendali.” 


 📊 Key Financial Ratios: 
 The analysis centered around: 
 -Current Ratio (CR): Assesses short-term liquidity.
 -Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Investment (ROI): Measures profitability. 
 -Cost of Debt (ROD): Evaluates the financial burden of debt.
 The subject company, "Alpha," demonstrated areas needing improvement:  Low Profitability: With the lowest ROE (0.3%) among its peers, Alpha shows minimal returns on equity investment. 
 Debt Management Concerns: A high ROD (9.9%)—the second highest in the group—indicates that debt expenses outpace investment returns.
 
 📉 Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Using PCA, we visualized Alpha's position relative to its peers, pinpointing the influence of profitability and liquidity on overall performance. The results positioned Alpha in the lower quadrant, indicating low profitability combined with a compromised financial equilibrium due to high debt costs.  
 
 📈 Visual Insights: plots from the report illustrate Alpha’s performance across these key financial ratios. These visuals provide a clearer view of Alpha's position in terms of liquidity, profitability, and cost of debt, making it easy to see where targeted improvements could be most effective.  
 
📈 Key Takeaways:  
-Profitability and Debt Management: A sustainable financial strategy requires improving ROI to surpass ROD and ensure debt expenses don't erode returns. 
-Strategic Focus on Liquidity: Enhancing liquidity beyond just current assets could better position Alpha for short-term financial obligations. 

These insights provide a robust foundation for strategic decision-making, helping companies identify key areas for financial improvement.
